                            Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film stars Tobey Maguire as 
                            the titular character, alongside Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, 
                            Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris. The film chronicles Spider-Man's origin story 
                            and early superhero career. After being bitten by a genetically altered spider, outcast 
                            teenager Peter Parker develops spider-like superhuman abilities and adopts a masked 
                            superhero identity to fight crime and injustice in New York City, facing the 
                            sinister Green Goblin in the process.Development on a live-action Spider-Man film began in

                             Filmmakers Tobe Hooper, James Cameron, and Joseph Zito were all attached to direct 
                             the film at one point. However, the project would languish in development hell due to 
                             licensing and financial issues. After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, 
                             it was licensed for a worldwide release by Columbia Pictures in 1999 after it acquired 
                             options from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films, 
                             Carolco, and New Cannon.</p>
